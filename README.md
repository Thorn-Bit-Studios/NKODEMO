Heyo, thanks for checking out the NKO demo! This will give you a taste of what we're cooking for the mod, as well as a taste of a different project in the works!

# What engine to use
This is a modpack for Codename Engine 1.0.1, this will not work on Psych or V-Slice. Please do not complain to us about it not working on those engines or ask us to port the mod to other engines (in fact, doing that would probably make us want to do it less).

If a Codename update does breaks the mod, let us know and we'll try to release a hotfix.

However, if you want to port this mod to other engines for us, please ask us first!
# License
You can make videos and streams on the mod, just at least link to the mod page please and thank you. Using the content of this mod outside of NKO is up to the discretion of the composer/artist/whatever.

All the credits for the people who worked on the demo are in the Credits menu under "Thorn-Bit Studios"!

# How to install
1. Install [Codename Engine 1.0.1](https://codename-engine.com/) if you haven't already.
